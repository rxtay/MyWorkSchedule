## Target Audience

Human resource agencies and teams offering employees flexible work schedules.

## Purpose

MyWorkSchedule aims to provide a hassle-free experience for employers to manage large employee groups across various organizations.

## Justification

Managing part-timers across multiple organizations and branches can be unorganized and inconvenient for employers. Traditionally, employers send work schedules to respective employee groups through messaging platforms. These platforms reflect all changes in any work schedule. However, changes in shift allocations result in variations of the same schedule, and both employers and employees are bound to experience inconveniences and miscommunications. Whereas, MyWorkScheldule offers a unified system for managing part-timers across multiple organizations and branches.
